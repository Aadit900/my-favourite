    <p >My hobby is reading intresting and knowledgeable books in my free time. Whenever I go to home from my school I like to read such books after completing my home-work. I am 10 years old and in class 5th standard. Now I know very well that reading books is a very good habit which can make me complete. This hobby can be developed by anyone however I got it naturally. Reading books keeps one happy and busy. It is the good source of enjoyment, knowledge, inspiration and instruction. It makes us disciplined, loyal, punctual and most importantly, a successful person in the life.</p>
